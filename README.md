 #Code Fellows JS-401

##Linked Lists
 This assignment consisted of taking function code that creates a linked list and adding a method called deleteListItem to a module called linked-list.js which allows you to designate how many nodes you want to traverse existing linked list and then delete the node that follows the targeted node.

## Getting Started
- Fork this repository: https://github.com/jlhiskey/10-recursion.git
- Clone this repository onto your local device.
- The local repository should now contain a folder structure that matches the one shown below.
    - lib/ : contains module definitions
    - data/ : contains the text files used by the program
    - --test__/ : contains unit tests
 - Now in your terminal you will need to install dependencies using 
the command:  npm i 
    - This will create a package.json file on your local device.
- To run test open your terminal use the command: npm run test

## Error Handling
- If user tries to use an empty list the application will throw an error that says: 
    - __ERROR__ The list is empty
- If user tries to input an offset value that is larger than the length of the list the application will throw an error that says: 
    - __ERROR__ The list has less items than specified offset
